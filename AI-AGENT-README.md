# AI Dating Assistant - Technical Documentation

## Overview

The AI Dating Assistant is an advanced feature of our blockchain-based dating application that helps users navigate conversations with potential matches. It uses AI to generate personalized responses based on the user's profile, conversation history, and communication preferences.

## Features

- **Multiple Response Types**: Supports various types of responses including normal replies, suggestions, conversation starters, and flirty messages.

### 2. AI Mode

- **Visual Countdown**: Shows a countdown timer before auto-sending messages.
- **Suggestion Generation**: Provides contextually relevant message suggestions even in manual mode.

3. The AI will automatically suggest and send messages based on your profile
4. You can disable AI Mode at any time to return to manual messaging

### Customizing AI Behavior

The AI behavior can be customized through your profile settings:

- **AI Proactiveness**: Controls how proactive the AI is in conversations (0-100%)
- **AI Response Style**: Sets the tone of AI responses (casual, formal, flirty, etc.)
- **AI Personality**: Defines the overall personality of your AI twin
- **Confidential Topics**: Specifies topics the AI should avoid discussing

## Security and Privacy

- All conversations are stored securely on the Verida blockchain

- The AI twin only has access to information explicitly shared in the user's profile

## Technical Limitations

- The AI may occasionally generate responses that don't perfectly match the user's communication style
- Response generation may take longer during peak usage times
- Very complex conversation contexts may result in less accurate responses

## Future Enhancements

- Emotion detection to better respond to the emotional context of conversations
- Multi-language support for international users
- Voice message transcription and generation
- Image recognition for context-aware responses to shared photos

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI not responding**: Check your internet connection and verify API keys are valid
2. **Unexpected responses**: Try refreshing the conversation or toggling AI mode off and on
3. **Loading errors**: Ensure your blockchain wallet is properly connected
